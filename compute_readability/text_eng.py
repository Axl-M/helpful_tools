I wrote this book because there is a distinct lack of good resources available for developers
new to Django REST Framework. The assumption seems to be that everyone already knows all
about APIs, HTTP, REST, and the like. My own journey in learning how to build web APIs was
frustratingâ€¦ and I already knew Django well enough to write a book on it!
This book is the guide I wish existed when starting out with Django REST Framework.
Chapter 1 begins with a brief introduction to web APIs and the HTTP protocol. In Chapter 2 we
review the differences between traditional Django and Django REST Framework by building out
a Library book website and then adding an API to it. Then in Chapters 3-4 we build a Todo API
and connect it to a React front-end. The same process can be used to connect any dedicated
front-end (web, iOS, Android, desktop, or other) to a web API back-end.
In Chapters 5-9 we build out a production-ready Blog API which includes full CRUD functionality.
We also cover in-depth permissions, user authentication, viewsets, routers, documentation, and
more.
